By using a genetic algorithm the fitness function finds more fit and fit populations til the problem is solved, or sometimes get stuck at a local maxima. The genetic functions looks at maximum number of non-attacking pair of queens, (n * (n-1) / 2). Then the function searches the board for attacking pairs of queens and removes one point from the point variable for each pair. The more points the fitter the individual and the best individual is used to produce new offspring. Repeat til solution is found.
