The main group assignment in the course Software Engineering Project Methods at Jönköping University.  The project was to produce a prototype of a nuclear power plant safety system. The system should be used by nuclear technicians when they clock in and clock out from a power plant. Furthermore, power plant managers should be able to monitor the activity of nuclear technicians. However, this project was more about how we used the agile method Scrum to achieve the end product.
