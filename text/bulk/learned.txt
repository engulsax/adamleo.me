I learned how to work within a team using Scrum. During the project I had educational meetings with a certified scrum master. One thing in particular that was very valuable was his opinion that backlog grooming meetings eases future work. An opinion that I took to heart. I know for a fact that having a product backlog groomed and ready really made a difference in our output velocity for each sprint, as we could see a clear improvement.
