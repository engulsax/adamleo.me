Hello! I am Adam. I am a programmer, software developer, and web developer. Avid defender of the oxford comma. I live in Sweden, more specifically the city of Jönköping. I am currently studying my last term of Software development at Jönköping University. 

I love spending time with my family, playing computer games with friends, and when there is time, meet up for some board game nights. I like all cogs within the technology wheel, which is why  I like to take on projects where I get to do a variety of different things; from design, to software, and sometimes even hardware.
